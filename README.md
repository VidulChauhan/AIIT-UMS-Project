# All India Institute of Technology ERP Software
This is a school project which was built using python 
# General information
Since the gui was made using Tkinter module, not much of the design could be created
so i used images wherever possible.
This contains almost all dynamic features making it shine above most projects:
* Supports Two-Factor-authentication
* Has built in software update system, so we need not install the newer one everytime, we can just update the existing software
* Best in class Graphics design
* Built-in dark mode
* Dynamic dark mode to be added soon 

NOTE : Please note that since the GUI was made using Tkinter, animations were nearly impossible to emplement at this early stage of the software
# Use and Utility
This is basically an simple ERP software for colleges and universities, 
just the looks and the user experience bumped up to a higher level.
The line of code is as simple as it could have been , so that future improvements can be made effortlesly.
